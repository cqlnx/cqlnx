# 👋 Hey, I'm Reimps

## About Me
I’m a **self-taught developer** who codes mainly for fun.  
I like experimenting with ideas and building things that I find interesting.

## 🧠 What I Use
- **Python**
- **JavaScript**
- **HTML** 

## 🛠 Projects
### Discord Bot (Minecraft-related)
My main project right now is a **Discord bot** that:
- Gives you **random Minecraft servers**
- Lets you **check if servers are whitelisted**
- Uses **Mineflayer** for the core functionality

The bot is currently running in this Discord server:

## 🎯 Goals
- Just coding for fun
- Learning by building and experimenting

## 📌 Notes
Still learning, still building, and improving as I go.
